	1. Add a new file to the "core" folder that will contain custom operators.
	2. Export a new operator named "logEagerReaders" that will take a weekly reading goal (in minutes) as a parameter.
	3. Open "data.service.ts" and update the call to "getAllReaders" so that it requests data from the server.
	4. Open "dashboard.component.ts" and add a new property to store a Subscription object.
	5. Add new code to "ngOnInit" to call "getAllReaders", apply the custom operator, subscribe to the result, and store the returned Subscription.
  6. Implement OnDestroy and unsubscribe from the Subscription.
	7. Build and run the app.
	8. Open the app in a browser to make sure everything still works.
